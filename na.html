			<h2 class="c8"> Early access reward to players</h2>
			<p class="c8">Early Access is finally here! We're extremely excited to bring the build into playable state for our loyal fans that stuck with us for all this time, thank you for all your support and patience!
			It's been a long journey from the first patch that started this project and the state it is now, I'd like to thank our teams who have worked in rough times, often overtime to make sure that this game is the right experience for our fans and fans of the series to come.
			This is the first official announcement of Alpha release to players. Further information can be found below.
			</br></br>
			Early access giveaway is going to take place soon, giving out keys in a system way to players that have supported us in any way in the past, this does not mean, however, that other players will not have the chance
			to test the game, the Alpha release is going to be open Alpha release, meaning we will be testing our server strength as well as the ability for everyone to enjoy their first experience.
			</br></br>Considering this is the first Alpha open stage of the game keep in mind that the key giveaway with special features to the supporters will be slow and kinda slugish to give out as the system will take 
			time to process all the receiving individuals, special thanks to the people that stuck with us all this time, as a gesture of gratitude we are rewarding these with a special in game badge and weapon skin, unlimited in use
			and ability to be applied to any and all in game weapons, existing now and in the future, this is a limited skin and will not be for sale in the future, as much as this sounds a tad unfair, we want people to know that that guy or this girl right there was here from the start!
			We have discussed about this subject plenty and came to a conclusion it's the right thing to do. You can still contribute to the game, any contribution is considered a supporter status, be it 1$ or more.
			New supporters will get their key skins last, last but not the least!</p>
