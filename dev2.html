			<h2 class="c8"> Dev blog #2 Grouping up</h2>
			<p class="c8">We'll talk about how our teams started working on the game in this article.</br>The start was - rough, no other word for it, in the beginning our design team, hardware team, head chiefs, everyone, we were all over the place.
			We didn't really know each other, had no background knowledge on each other, imagine a group of people that have to spend all their time to sync in hope they will cover their deadlines, pretty much that. Luckily for me, Chris was the only guy I knew from the start, current design team leader.
			</br></br>First few weeks were fairly slow and not very productive, teams were getting to know each other individually, let alone team synergy with other teams, we were basically small groups, all working on the same game, as if everyone has their own unique game to make.
			</br></br> Soon enough we pulled ourselves together and started working on the projects we would later combine. Head devs pitched in organised couple of meetings and trips to make sure we would get to know each other, this is quite unusual practice for any company, especially game development one.
</br> I'm pretty grateful for their practice, it assured we would function as a team and keep to our deadlines. Props to them.	 		</p>
