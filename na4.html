			<h2 class="c8"> Road to Alpha, part 2</h2>
			<p class="c8">Latest update on our progress towards Alpha, 
			</br>When it comes to releasing a game into Alpha stage a lot of questions are raised. Is the game ready? Does that mean the game will come out full of bugs and try to cash in? Will the developers cash in and leave?
			</br>Luckily, we can answer these question, right here, now.</br></br>
			Let's talk about the game in it's current state, it's functional, optimised for the most part, introduced with the latest content, tested and proven to be working as intended. Are we going to release it now? Not quite yet, it's not ready just yet.
			Taking a game into open Alpha is a big step, we can't just release it and hope for the best, there's server load, area load, items in the world, all depend on amount of players. Considering we are likely to release it to all players this means the amount of players is likely to be high from day one, which means a ton of stress on all those parts.
			At the moment, we're still testing out the servers as we want to be sure Metro 2035 doesn't become another day one - logging in - scenario, where players can't even get into the game because of the overload on equipment.
			</br></br>
			Now, let's talk about what Alpha actually means, because we will 99% release the game for free, open Alpha, I think we can throw cashing in and leaving out of the window, we  made this game to continue the series and not to grab a quick buck and leave you rotting in toxic wastelands.
			WIll the game have bugs? Of course it will, we cannot test every single part of the game as well as players can, no one can guarantee a perfect game, not even completely finished ones. We'll make sure our team is ready to tackle these with bugfix patches that will be released often on the release itself.
			Alpha is near, that's for sure, after announcing the Alpha in part one, we received a ton of feedback and support, but a lot of concerns about the future as well. That feedback didn't fall on deaf ears.
			</br>
			</br></br>
			Thanks for reading and see you all in the next notes.</p>
