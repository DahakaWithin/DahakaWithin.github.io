			<h2 class="c8"> Patch notes 0.39, June</h2>
			<p class="c8">Added textures, fixed player models, AI updated, plans for new areas, context on hidden achievement system. 
			</br>Latest patch notes for Metro 2035.</br></br>
			- Added textures, some textures have been missing from the main game as we tried to find the best way to implement them and made sure they would fit the game. Instead of lots of smaller patches on the ground of the same texture, we added several textures for pretty much everything!
			Our design team has been working hard to put all the missing pieces together, providing the mood and setting the tone to the rest of the game.
			</br></br>
			- Fixed player models, over the testing periods we noticed player models were...slightly off, a bit of clothing here, bit of arms sticking out where they shouldn't and such. Because we made the original models completely out of sync with the visuals they would receive (place holders), the final version is not spotless, we remade the models so they 
			would fit better to the gas masks, equipment, armour and such in a smoother way. The small details were really hurting the overall impressions and fixing that is a huge plus for us.
			</br></br>
			- AI, update to NPC AI as promised, newly implemented system is proving to be a much greater challenge to players than before, don't get us wrong, the old AI wasn't bad, it did its job quite nicely, but in the end we decided we want to step up on monster AI as they are the main focus of the game.
				We will be looking closely how the AI performs over these few weeks to ensure everything is working like a charm.
			</br></br>
			Achievement system, hidden treasures, Metro series always reworded players for exploration, additional guns, ammo, gas mask filters, all the goodies, plus some neat interactions and moral points. We want to build on current system, expanding it and creating a new feel inside the game without making the main storyline irrelevant.
			New system will continue with the tradition in which exploring small areas and finding the secrets will provide you with equipment and supplies that can prove life saving, additionally, these areas will not provide occasional puzzle type of activity, when solved, players will enter special rooms with collectables and supplies which can be traded to other players or kept for showing off.
			This new system will bring the game a bit closer to open world, MMORPG feel we're looking for, plenty more to come as the team is eager to create more, more complex interactions.
			</br></br>Thanks for reading and see you all in the next notes.</p>
